My models have 100% accuracy!!!

Now that I have your attention...

Hi, I am VenuGopal! I can solve almost all data engineering-related agonies!!! I am skilled in Python, SQL, Pyspark,Azure Databricks,Azure data factory,Azure synapse, Power BI,Snowflake,BigData,Hadoop,BI Reporting,Azure/AWS cloud and Automate Testing using Selenium. I have solved business problems using Data Engineering, ETL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Time-series forecasting.

I work as a Data Engineering with US Healthcare and here are my humble contributions:

Identified major KPIs for hospitals which in turn, have helped healthcare systems to assess their performance.

Created multiple healthcare-related dashboards with automated refresh and continuous data feed leading to a reduction in manual data extraction workload. These dashboards helped to identify the percentage of missing data in the database which is critical for proper diagnosis

Forecasted drug demand for pharmacy concerning specific drugs, hence, cutting down the overall purchase cost as well as reducing the drug wastage.

Developed clinical decision support tools for diseases requiring early detection with help of Machine Learning, leading to a decrease in frequent invasive procedures.

Optimized stored procedures and queries, cutting down the report run time.

I am more data-informed than data-driven. I want my data to tell stories that are relatable, understandable, and actionable which would aid data-informed business decisions.

If all of this sounds interesting to you and you are wondering if I would be good fit for your business, letâ€™s talk!
